**MarkDownToPdf**
=================

This tiny R&D project deals with converting multiple markdown files to single pdf.

I have mainly used composer for managing the library dependencies.


----------

*The major topics covered are*:
-----------------------------
 
 - **``MarkDown``** to **``html``** to **``pdf``** -- single and batch conversion.
 - Merging multiple **``pdf``** to *single* **``pdf``** file.
